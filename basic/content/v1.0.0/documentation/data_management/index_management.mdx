This documentation page provides guidance on configuring and managing data indexes and related system settings within UTMStack v10.9.0. Index management is crucial for maintaining the organization, performance, and storage efficiency of your log data.

## Index Management Overview

Index management in UTMStack allows for maintaining the organization and performance of indices, similar to Elasticsearch. It facilitates the administration of indices, including their deletion and monitoring. Indices are automatically named based on the date and type of logs they contain.

The status `open` indicates that an index is active and can be written to or searched.

## Managing Indices

To administer your indices:

*   **Delete an index**: Click on the delete action (❌) next to the index you wish to remove. Be cautious as this action is irreversible.
*   **Monitor Performance**: Regularly monitor the size and document count of your indices to ensure optimal performance and storage management.

## Searching Within an Index

You can filter and search for specific indices using the search bar at the top of the index table.

## Data Retention and Index Rollover

Data Retention defines policies for storing and managing log data in UTMStack, ensuring compliance with security regulations and optimizing storage efficiency. A key feature of data retention that directly impacts index management is Index Rollover.

### Index Rollover

UTMStack’s Index Rollover feature ensures optimal data management by automatically deleting indices once they meet specific conditions, such as data size or age.

**How to Configure Index Rollover:**

1.  Go to `Application Management` > `Data Retention`.
2.  Set the desired retention period in days.
3.  Click ‘Save’ to confirm your changes.

**Key Features of Index Rollover:**

*   **Delete Days**: This setting allows you to define how long the data will be kept. After this period, data is flagged for deletion, which helps in optimizing space and maintaining system performance.

**Note**: The system automatically takes action when the disk usage reaches 85%, ensuring it doesn’t affect system performance.

### Snapshot Archiving

As part of data retention, UTMStack also offers Snapshot Archiving for managing data storage. This feature involves understanding hot and cold storage concepts.

## Summary

Index Management in UTMStack provides tools for organizing, maintaining, and optimizing your log data indices. This includes the ability to delete and search indices, along with automated data lifecycle management through features like Index Rollover, which is configured via Data Retention policies. Monitoring index size and document count is recommended for optimal system performance and storage management.

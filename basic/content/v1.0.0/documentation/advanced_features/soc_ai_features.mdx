This documentation page provides an overview of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities available within UTMStack for security operations center (SOC) automation. These features are designed to enhance threat detection, analysis, and response by leveraging advanced analytical methods.

## Introduction to SOC AI Features

UTMStack integrates Artificial Intelligence to provide advanced security operations center capabilities. These AI-driven features contribute to a unified threat management platform that delivers essential security services, including threat detection and response. The platform utilizes AI to analyze security data, identify anomalies, and support security professionals in managing and responding to threats.

## Key AI Components

The SOC AI features in UTMStack are powered by several core components:

### Artificial Intelligence Security Operations Center Analyst
UTMStack includes an Artificial Intelligence Security Operations Center Analyst, which is provided through integration with OpenAI. This component assists in security operations by leveraging AI for analysis.

### Machine Learning Anomaly-based Engine
The platform incorporates a Machine Learning Anomaly-based engine that performs the following functions:
*   Analyzes the environment to define custom rules and baselines.
*   Learns from the environment to gain the ability to identify abnormal and threatening behavior.

### Heuristic and Rule-based Analysis Engine
In addition to machine learning, UTMStack utilizes a Heuristic and Rule-based analysis engine for threat detection.

## AI-Powered Capabilities and Benefits

Artificial Intelligence enhances various security operations within UTMStack, leading to improved effectiveness in threat prevention and response.

### Enhanced Threat Detection and Response
AI-powered analysis contributes to:
*   Swiftly analyzing log data to identify and halt threats.
*   Improving real-time correlation, especially when all data is centralized, which increases the effectiveness of correlation engines and machine learning algorithms.
*   Enhancing threat detection, response, and remediation across digital infrastructure.

### Threat Intelligence Database Correlation
AI supports the Threat Intelligence Database correlation feature by:
*   Analyzing all available security IP feeds.
*   Focusing on feeds related to online attacks, online service abuse, malware, botnets, command and control servers, and other cybercrime activities.

### Advanced Data Analysis and Investigation
AI capabilities support the analysis of security data, including:
*   **Investigating Suspicious Activities**: Aggregating and summarizing sets of data, filtering, tracking, and exporting log data, and performing forensic analysis.
*   **Monitoring and Analyzing Security Data**: Building customized dashboards or using existing ones, and exploring systems data in near real-time to respond to incidents.

## Availability

Artificial Intelligence, including SOC AI-powered analysis, is a feature included in the **Enterprise version** of UTMStack. These features are designed to benefit enterprises and Managed Service Providers (MSPs).

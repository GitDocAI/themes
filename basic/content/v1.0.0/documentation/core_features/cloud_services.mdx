* **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** - Complete AWS ecosystem
* **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** - Full GCP services
* **Microsoft Azure** - Azure cloud services
* **DigitalOcean** - Simple cloud infrastructure

## Getting Started with Cloud Integration

### Prerequisites

Before connecting to cloud services:

1. Active account with your chosen provider
2. API credentials or access keys
3. Appropriate permissions configured
4. Billing set up (if required)

## AWS Integration

### Setting Up AWS

Connect your AWS account in three steps:

#### Step 1: Generate Access Keys

Create IAM credentials in the AWS console with appropriate permissions.

#### Step 2: Configure Credentials

Add your AWS credentials to the configuration:

```yaml
cloud:
  provider: aws
  region: us-east-1
  credentials:
    access_key_id: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    secret_access_key: YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

> ***Never commit credentials to version control.*** Use environment variables instead.

#### Step 3: Verify Connection

Test your AWS connection:

```bash
platform cloud test
```

### AWS Services

#### Compute Services

* **EC2** - Virtual machines
* **Lambda** - Serverless functions
* **ECS** - Container orchestration

#### Storage Services

* **S3** - Object storage
* **EBS** - Block storage
* **EFS** - File storage

#### Database Services

* **RDS** - Relational databases
* **DynamoDB** - NoSQL database
* **ElastiCache** - In-memory caching

## Google Cloud Platform

### GCP Setup

Similar to AWS, but with GCP-specific configuration:

```yaml
cloud:
  provider: gcp
  project_id: your-project-id
  region: us-central1
  credentials_file: /path/to/service-account.json
```

### Key GCP Services

1. **Compute Engine** - VMs and instances
2. **Cloud Storage** - Object storage
3. **Cloud SQL** - Managed databases
4. **Cloud Functions** - Serverless computing

## Microsoft Azure

### Azure Configuration

Connect to Azure using:

```yaml
cloud:
  provider: azure
  subscription_id: your-subscription-id
  resource_group: your-resource-group
  region: eastus
```

### Azure Services

* **Virtual Machines** - Compute instances
* **Blob Storage** - Object storage
* **Azure SQL** - Managed SQL databases
* **Functions** - Serverless platform

## Storage Solutions

### Object Storage

Use cloud object storage for files and media:

```bash
# Upload a file
platform storage upload local-file.pdf bucket/path/

# Download a file
platform storage download bucket/path/file.pdf local-file.pdf

# List files
platform storage list bucket/path/
```

### Database Integration

Connect to managed databases:

```yaml
database:
  type: postgresql
  host: your-db.region.provider.com
  port: 5432
  name: production_db
  ssl: true
```

## Monitoring & Logging

### Cloud Monitoring

All cloud providers offer monitoring solutions:

* **AWS CloudWatch** - AWS metrics and logs
* **GCP Cloud Monitoring** - GCP observability
* **Azure Monitor** - Azure monitoring suite

### Log Aggregation

Centralize your logs from all cloud services:

```yaml
logging:
  destination: cloud
  retention_days: 30
  level: info
```

## Security Best Practices

### Network Security

1. **Use VPC/VNet** - Isolate your resources
2. **Configure firewalls** - Restrict access
3. **Enable encryption** - Protect data in transit and at rest
4. **Implement IAM** - Least privilege access

> Always follow the *principle of least privilege* when granting permissions.

### Credentials Management

* Store credentials in environment variables
* Use secret management services (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
* Rotate credentials regularly
* Never log or expose credentials

## Cost Optimization

### Monitor Your Spending

Track cloud costs effectively:

* Set up billing alerts
* Review usage regularly
* Use cost allocation tags
* Implement auto-scaling

### Cost-Saving Tips

1. Use reserved instances for predictable workloads
2. Implement auto-shutdown for dev/test environments
3. Choose appropriate instance sizes
4. Leverage spot/preemptible instances

## Backup & Disaster Recovery

### Automated Backups

Configure automatic backups:

```yaml
backup:
  enabled: true
  frequency: daily
  retention: 30
  regions:
    - primary: us-east-1
    - secondary: us-west-2
```

### Disaster Recovery

Implement a disaster recovery strategy:

* ***Regular backups*** to multiple regions
* *Automated failover* configuration
* **Recovery time objectives (RTO)** planning
* **Recovery point objectives (RPO)** definition

## Next Steps

* Configure [Security Settings](/v1.0.0/documentation/core_features/security_configuration)
* Set up [Monitoring](/v1.0.0/documentation/core_features/monitoring_analytics)
* Review our API examples

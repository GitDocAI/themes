# Intrusion Detection

UTMStack offers comprehensive intrusion detection capabilities for both network and host environments. It employs a multi-faceted approach, leveraging rule-based, heuristic, and machine learning technologies to monitor and analyze security data, identify abnormal behavior, and detect threats.

## Core Capabilities

The platform provides robust intrusion detection functionalities, including:

*   **Network Intrusion Detection**: Rule-based detection specifically for network activities.
*   **Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)**: Utilizes rule-based and heuristic analysis with Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) capabilities.
*   **Network Traffic, Protocol, and DNS Analysis**: Deep analysis of network communications to identify suspicious patterns.
*   **Integrated IDS/IPS**: As a core security service, UTMStack includes network/host IDS/IPS capabilities.

## Detection Technologies

UTMStack's intrusion detection is powered by a sophisticated threat detection engine:

### Threat Detection Engine

The UTMStack threat detection engine is composed of several rule-based correlation systems, scanners, and AI-powered machine learning algorithms. These modules operate independently, and their functionalities can overlap and interact to generate a holistic analysis of events.

### Heuristic and Rule-based Analysis Engine

*   UTMStack leverages powerful correlation engines with a total of 154,000 detection rules.
*   These engines aggregate, correlate, and analyze log data, network traffic, and system internal activity.
*   They process data generated by on-premises and cloud devices or Software as a Service (SaaS).

### Machine Learning Anomaly-based Engine

*   This engine analyzes the environment and defines custom rules and baselines.
*   Through this learning mechanism, the system learns from the environment.
*   It gains the ability to identify abnormal and threatening behavior.

## Monitoring and Analysis

Intrusion detection is seamlessly integrated with UTMStack's broader monitoring and analysis tools, enabling effective incident response and investigation:

### Monitor and Analyze Security Data

*   Users can build customized dashboards or utilize existing ones to visualize security data.
*   The system allows exploration of systems data in near real-time to facilitate quick responses to incidents.

### Investigate Suspicious Activities

*   Provides capabilities to aggregate and summarize sets of data.
*   Enables filtering, tracking, and exporting of log data.
*   Supports performing forensic analysis to understand the scope and nature of incidents.

## Platform Integration

Intrusion detection is a core component of the UTMStack Unified Threat Management Platform. Designed for hybrid environments, it can be easily deployed across on-premises and cloud providers. By bundling several cybersecurity products under a single platform, UTMStack consolidates all security data in one place, which increases the effectiveness of its correlation engines and machine learning algorithms.

## Summary

UTMStack delivers advanced intrusion detection capabilities through a combination of rule-based, heuristic, and machine learning engines. It provides comprehensive monitoring of network traffic, protocols, DNS, and host activities. Leveraging a vast array of detection rules and an adaptive anomaly detection system, UTMStack is designed to identify and alert on threats. These detection features are complemented by integrated monitoring, analysis, and forensic tools, enabling real-time incident response and thorough investigation of suspicious activities across diverse IT environments.

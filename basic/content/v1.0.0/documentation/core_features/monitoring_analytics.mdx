# Monitoring & Analytics

Get deep insights into your application performance, user behavior, and system health with comprehensive monitoring and analytics capabilities.

## Real-time Monitoring

### Application Performance Monitoring

Track your application's performance metrics in real-time to identify issues before they impact users.

**Key Metrics:**

- **Response Times** - Monitor API endpoint latency and performance
- **Throughput** - Track requests per second and capacity
- **Error Rates** - Monitor application errors and exceptions
- **Database Performance** - Query execution times and connection pools
- **Resource Utilization** - CPU, memory, and disk usage patterns

> The platform automatically instruments your application for monitoring without requiring code changes.

### Performance Baselines

Establish performance baselines to detect anomalies and degradation:

1. Track historical performance data
2. Identify normal operating ranges
3. Set thresholds based on actual patterns
4. Alert on deviations from baseline
5. Automatically adjust for seasonal patterns

## Infrastructure Monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Monitoring Issues

#### Missing Metrics

If metrics aren't appearing, verify:

- Agent is running and connected

- No filtering rules blocking metrics

#### Alert Fatigue

Too many alerts reduce effectiveness. To address:

1. Review and adjust alert thresholds
2. Implement alert grouping and suppression
3. Use anomaly detection instead of static thresholds
4. Create escalation policies for different severities
5. Regularly review and remove obsolete alerts

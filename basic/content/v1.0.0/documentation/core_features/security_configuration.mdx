* **Network Security** - VPC isolation and firewall protection
* **Compliance Support** - Tools for SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA compliance
* **Vulnerability Scanning** - Automated security checks and monitoring

> Security is enabled by default. All communications are encrypted and access is logged for audit purposes.

## Authentication Methods

The platform supports multiple authentication methods. You can use one or combine several for enhanced security:

<Accordion multiple>
  <AccordionTab header="API Key Authentication">
    API keys provide simple and secure authentication for programmatic access.

    **Key Management Best Practices**

    1. Rotate API keys regularly (recommended: every 90 days)
    2. Use different keys for different environments
    3. Monitor API key usage patterns for anomalies
    4. Implement key scoping to limit access permissions
    5. Store keys securely using environment variables

    > ***Never commit API keys to version control.*** Always use environment variables or secure secret management services.

    **Example Configuration:**

    ```bash
    export API_KEY=your_secure_api_key_here
    export API_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
    ```
  </AccordionTab>

  <AccordionTab header="OAuth 2.0 Integration">
    Connect with popular identity providers for seamless user authentication. Supported providers include Google, GitHub, Microsoft, and other major platforms.

    **OAuth Configuration**

    OAuth integration enables users to authenticate using their existing accounts, reducing friction and improving security through established identity providers.

    **Supported Providers:**

    * **Google** - OAuth 2.0 with Google accounts
    * **GitHub** - OAuth Apps integration
    * **Microsoft** - Azure Active Directory
    * **Facebook** - Facebook Login
    * **Custom OIDC** - Any OpenID Connect provider

    **Benefits:**

    * No password management required
    * Leverages existing trusted accounts
    * Improved user experience
    * Enhanced security through provider MFA
  </AccordionTab>

  <AccordionTab header="JWT Token Management">
    JSON Web Tokens (JWT) enable stateless authentication across distributed systems. Tokens are automatically signed using industry-standard algorithms for maximum security.

    **Token Security Features**

    * Tokens expire automatically after a configurable period
    * Refresh tokens enable long-lived sessions
    * Token validation happens on every request
    * Compromised tokens can be revoked immediately

    **Token Structure:**

    A JWT consists of three parts:

    1. **Header** - Token type and signing algorithm
    2. **Payload** - Claims and user information
    3. **Signature** - Verification signature

    **Best Practices:**

    * Use short expiration times (15-30 minutes)
    * Implement refresh token rotation
    * Store tokens securely (httpOnly cookies)
    * Validate tokens on every protected request
  </AccordionTab>

  <AccordionTab header="Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)">
    Add an extra layer of security with multi-factor authentication.

    **MFA Methods:**

    * **TOTP** - Time-based One-Time Passwords (Google Authenticator, Authy)
    * **SMS** - Text message verification codes
    * **Email** - Email-based verification
    * **Hardware Keys** - YubiKey and other FIDO2 devices

    **Implementation:**

    MFA can be required for:

    * All users (enforced)
    * Specific roles (administrators, editors)
    * Sensitive operations (password changes, permission updates)
    * IP-based policies (new locations, suspicious activity)

    > ***Recommendation:*** Enable MFA for all administrative accounts.
  </AccordionTab>
</Accordion>

## Role-Based Access Control

### Understanding RBAC

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enables granular permission management across your applications. Define roles and assign specific permissions to control what users can do.

### Common Role Patterns

###### Administrator Role

Full access to all system features and configurations. Use sparingly and audit regularly.

###### Editor Role

Can read, write, and update content but cannot modify system settings or user permissions.

###### Viewer Role

Read-only access to resources. Cannot make changes but can view and export data.

### Permission Management

Implement permission checks throughout your application to ensure users only access authorized resources. Permissions can be assigned at resource, feature, or action levels.

## Data Encryption

### Encryption at Rest

All stored data is encrypted using AES-256 encryption, the industry standard for data at rest.

**Protected Data Types:**

* **Database Records** - Transparent data encryption for all database content
* **File Storage** - Server-side encryption with customer-managed keys
* **Backups** - Encrypted backups and snapshots
* **Configuration Files** - Sensitive configuration data encrypted

### Encryption in Transit

All data transmitted between clients and servers is protected using modern encryption protocols.

**Security Protocols:**

1. **TLS 1.3** - Latest transport layer security protocol
2. **Certificate Management** - Automatic SSL certificate renewal and validation
3. **HSTS** - HTTP Strict Transport Security enforced
4. **Perfect Forward Secrecy** - Unique session keys protect past sessions

### Application-Level Encryption

For sensitive data requiring additional protection, implement application-level encryption before storage. This provides an extra security layer beyond infrastructure encryption.

## Network Security

### Virtual Private Cloud

Isolate your applications in private networks with configurable network topology. VPC provides network-level isolation and control.

#### Network Segmentation

* **Public Subnets** - Internet-facing resources with controlled access
* **Private Subnets** - Internal resources isolated from internet
* **Database Subnets** - Dedicated isolated networks for databases
* **Management Subnets** - Secure access for administrative functions

### Firewall Configuration

Configure firewall rules to control network traffic between resources and from external sources.

**Firewall Best Practices:**

1. Default deny all traffic
2. Explicitly allow only required traffic
3. Use IP allowlisting for administrative access
4. Regular review and audit of firewall rules
5. Implement egress filtering for outbound traffic

> *Always follow the principle of least privilege when configuring network access.*

## Security Monitoring

### Audit Logging

Comprehensive audit logs capture all security-relevant events for compliance and forensic analysis.

**Logged Events:**

* Authentication attempts (successful and failed)
* Authorization decisions and permission checks
* Data access and modifications
* Configuration changes
* Administrative actions

### Security Alerts

Configure automated alerts for suspicious activities and security incidents. Real-time alerting enables rapid response to potential threats.

#### Alert Types

* **Failed Authentication** - Multiple failed login attempts
* **Privilege Escalation** - Unauthorized permission changes
* **Data Exfiltration** - Unusual data transfer patterns
* **Configuration Changes** - Modifications to security settings

### Vulnerability Management

Regular vulnerability scanning identifies potential security issues before they can be exploited.

**Scanning Coverage:**

* Dependency vulnerability scanning
* Container image security scanning
* Static code analysis for security issues
* Infrastructure configuration scanning
* Network security assessment

* Minimum length: 12 characters
* Require uppercase and lowercase letters
* Require numbers and special characters
* Password expiration and history
* Multi-factor authentication enforcement

#### Session Management

* Configure appropriate session timeouts
* Limit concurrent sessions per user
* Implement session invalidation on logout
* Secure session token storage
* Monitor for session hijacking attempts

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Handling

Establish a clear process for handling security incidents:

1. **Detection** - Identify and validate security incidents
2. **Containment** - Isolate affected systems to prevent spread
3. **Investigation** - Analyze the incident to understand impact
4. **Eradication** - Remove threats and vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery** - Restore normal operations securely
6. **Lessons Learned** - Document and improve security posture

# XDR Features

UTMStack is a Unified Threat Management Platform that merges Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) technologies to provide comprehensive threat hunting and analysis. This platform is designed to deliver essential security services, enabling real-time correlation of log data, threat intelligence, and malware activity patterns from multiple sources. It aims to identify and halt complex threats that utilize stealthy techniques, offering an effective, holistic cybersecurity suite for hybrid environments.

## Core XDR Capabilities

UTMStack's XDR capabilities enhance threat detection, response, and remediation across digital infrastructure by integrating various security functions:

### Threat Detection and Response
The platform offers real-time threat detection and response, focusing on identifying and halting threats at their source. This includes:
*   Real-time correlation
*   Threat Detection Technology leveraging rule-based correlation systems, scanners, and AI-powered machine learning algorithms.

### Incident Response and Endpoint Protection
Automated and on-demand capabilities for rapid incident handling:
*   Host lockdown
*   IP block
*   Remote-control console
*   Antivirus Integration
*   Endpoint Protection Integration

### Network and Host Intrusion Detection
Comprehensive monitoring for network and host-based threats:
*   Rule-based Network Intrusion Detection
*   Rule-based and heuristic analysis-based Host Intrusion Detection System with ATP capabilities
*   Network traffic, protocol, and DNS analysis

### User Auditor
Monitoring and tracking user activities to identify suspicious behavior:
*   User Activity monitoring
*   Suspicious activity monitoring
*   Identity Activity Management (tracks user activity)

### File Classification and Tracking
Monitoring and tracking changes and access to files to ensure integrity:
*   File Changes and access Tracking
*   Activity monitoring
*   File Integrity monitoring

## Advanced Detection Technologies

UTMStack's threat detection engine utilizes a combination of advanced technologies for holistic analysis of events:

### Heuristic and Rule-based Analysis Engine
This engine leverages powerful correlation engines with a total of 154,000 detection rules. It aggregates, correlates, and analyzes log data, network traffic, and system internal activity generated by on-premises, cloud devices, or SaaS applications.

### Machine Learning Anomaly-based Engine
This engine analyzes the environment to define custom rules and baselines. This learning mechanism allows the system to learn from the environment and gain the ability to identify abnormal and threatening behavior.

### Threat Intelligence Database Correlation
The platform analyzes all available security IP feeds, primarily related to online attacks, online service abuse, malware, botnets, command and control servers, and other cybercrime activities.

### SOC AI-Powered Analysis
Provided through integration with OpenAI, this feature enhances security operations center analysis with artificial intelligence.

## Visibility and Analysis

UTMStack provides robust tools for monitoring, analyzing, and visualizing security data:

### Log Management (SIEM)
*   Log collection and correlation in real-time
*   Log management
*   Log and event explorer for forensic analysis

### Advanced Data Visualization and Reporting
The platform includes a powerful dashboard and report builder, allowing for personalized monitoring and advanced compliance auditing. Dashboards and reports can be created, modified, and deleted without writing code, offering flexibility to build the entire stack.
*   Aggregate and summarize sets of data
*   Filter, track, and export log data
*   Perform forensic analysis
*   Build customized dashboards or use existing ones
*   Explore systems data in near real-time and respond to incidents

### Investigate Suspicious Activities

# SIEM Capabilities

UTMStack is a unified, open-source cybersecurity platform that provides comprehensive Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) capabilities. It merges SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and XDR (Extended Detection and Response) technologies to offer real-time threat detection, response, and compliance. The platform is designed for hybrid environments, simplifying cybersecurity operations across on-premises and cloud providers.

## Core SIEM Features

### Log Management and Real-time Correlation
UTMStack delivers robust log management, including:
*   Log collection and correlation in real-time.
*   Comprehensive log management functionalities.
*   A powerful Dashboard and Report Builder.
*   A Log and Event Explorer for forensic analysis.

Correlation happens before data ingestion, which helps reduce workload and improve response times. The platform's unique approach allows real-time correlation of log data, threat intelligence, and malware activity patterns from multiple sources, enabling the identification and halting of complex threats.

### Threat Detection Technology
The UTMStack threat detection engine integrates various systems for a holistic analysis of events. Its modules operate independently, with functionalities sometimes overlapping and interacting to generate a comprehensive analysis:
*   **Heuristic and Rule-based Analysis Engine**: Leverages powerful correlation engines with a total of 154,000 detection rules. These rules aggregate, correlate, and analyze log data, network traffic, and system internal activity generated by on-premises, cloud devices, or SaaS applications.
*   **Machine Learning Anomaly-based Engine**: Analyzes the environment to define custom rules and baselines. This learning mechanism enables the system to learn from the environment and identify abnormal and threatening behavior.
*   **Threat Intelligence Database Correlation**: Analyzes all available security IP feeds, primarily related to online attacks, online service abuse, malware, botnets, command and control servers, and other cybercrime activities. Specific threat intelligence covers spam, malware, botnets, service abuse IP related, denial of service, and brute force attack and scanner IPs.

### Correlation Rules
UTMStack includes customizable correlation rules. A dedicated repository for correlation rules welcomes community contributions.

## Advanced Analytics and Reporting

### Data Visualization and Reporting
The platform offers advanced data visualization and reporting capabilities, built on a proprietary data visualization and analysis engine that provides flexibility for advanced users:
*   Dashboards and reports can be created, modified, and deleted without writing a single line of code.
*   Supports building customized dashboards or using existing ones.
*   Enables exploration of systems data in near real-time and incident response.
*   Allows monitoring and analysis of security data.

### Investigating Suspicious Activities
UTMStack facilitates the investigation of suspicious activities by allowing users to:
*   Aggregate and summarize sets of data.
*   Filter, track, and export log data.
*   Perform forensic analysis through log exploring.

## Compliance Management

UTMStack simplifies compliance management by combining essential security tools into a single database, reinforced by an event and logs explorer and a report/dashboard builder.
*   **Compliance Reports**: Provides built-in reports for various standards, including HIPAA, GLBA, SOC 2, GPDR, FISMA, CMMC, and PCI-DSS.
*   **Compliance Dashboards**: Offers compliance status dashboards and allows for the creation of custom compliance reports and dashboards for continuous monitoring.
*   **Audit Support**: Generates custom reports for audits or compliance checks and assessments.

## Supported Environments and Integrations

UTMStack is designed for hybrid environments and can be easily deployed across on-premises and cloud providers, including:
*   Azure and AWS
*   Windows and Linux servers and endpoints
*   Hypervisors (KVM, HyperV, VMWare, etc.)
*   PaaS and SaaS applications like Office365, Google Cloud
*   Physical Infrastructure datacenter
*   Proprietary devices like CISCO and Sophos
*   Software like SharePoint and SQL Server
*   Container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker)

The platform integrates with other security services such as network/host IDS/IPS, Endpoint Protection, and Artificial Intelligence Security Operations Center Analyst (via integration with OpenAI).

## Benefits of UTMStack's SIEM

By bundling several cybersecurity products under a single platform, UTMStack offers a cost-effective and simpler solution. This approach reduces the learning curve for security professionals and the costs associated with buying different tools from multiple vendors. Having all data in a single place increases the effectiveness of correlation engines and machine learning algorithms.

## Summary

UTMStack provides comprehensive SIEM capabilities through real-time log management, advanced threat detection leveraging rule-based, heuristic, and machine learning engines, and robust threat intelligence correlation. It supports extensive data visualization, reporting, and forensic analysis, alongside streamlined compliance management for various regulatory standards. As a unified platform, it enhances threat detection, response, and remediation across diverse digital infrastructures in hybrid environments.

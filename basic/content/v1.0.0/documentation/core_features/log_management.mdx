## Log Explorer Module

The Log Explorer Module is a central, dynamic, and highly interactive tool within UTMStack, purpose-built to provide an exhaustive and comprehensive view of an organizationâ€™s log data. It offers real-time visibility, enabling immediate filtering and nuanced analysis, which is critical for proactive monitoring and effective management of network activities.

### Overview

The Log Explorer interface is designed for seamless navigation and efficient functionality. Its centerpiece is the **Data Grid**, which offers an extensive view of log data based on defined data sources and queries. This module supports:

*   Logical grouping of queries based on user-defined filters.
*   The capacity to open multiple tabs for various queries.
*   Customization to save search criteria for future use.
*   Visually intuitive representations of logs.

### Key Interface Elements and Actions

The Log Explorer module includes several features for detailed log investigation:

*   **Source**: Defines the origin of the log data.
*   **Filters**: Allows for immediate filtering of log data.
*   **Data Grid**: Displays the extensive view of log data.
*   **The Log**: Refers to individual log entries.
*   **Options**: Provides settings for log data manipulation.
*   **Personalize Fields**: Customizes the fields displayed in the log view.
*   **Save the information**: Option to save current log information.
*   **Save Query**: Enables users to save their search criteria for future use.

The module supports investigating suspicious activities by allowing users to aggregate and summarize sets of data, filter, track, and export log data, and perform forensic analysis.

## Correlation Rules

UTMStack leverages powerful correlation engines as part of its log management capabilities to enhance threat detection. These engines are designed to analyze data before ingestion and maximize real-time correlation.

*   **Extensive Detection Rules**: The platform includes a total of 154,000 detection rules.
*   **Data Aggregation and Analysis**: These rules aggregate, correlate, and analyze log data, network traffic, and system internal activity.
*   **Diverse Data Sources**: Data for correlation is sourced from on-premises devices, cloud providers, and SaaS applications.
*   **Real-time Correlation**: The correlation engine is built to analyze data in real-time, contributing to faster correlation, particularly in the enterprise version which offers this as a distinct feature.

## Integration with Dashboards and Reporting

Log management data feeds directly into UTMStack's advanced data visualization and reporting capabilities. The platform includes a powerful Dashboard and Report Builder, allowing users to:

*   Personalize their monitoring experience by building customized dashboards.
*   Generate custom reports for audits or compliance checks and assessments.
*   Create compliance dashboards for continuous monitoring.
*   Leverage existing reports for various compliance standards such as HIPAA, GLBA, GPDR, and SOC.

## Summary

UTMStack's Log Management (SIEM) is a foundational service that unifies log collection, real-time correlation, and advanced analysis. Through the interactive Log Explorer Module, powerful correlation engines with extensive rule sets, and integrated dashboard and reporting tools, UTMStack provides comprehensive visibility, forensic capabilities, and robust support for threat detection and compliance requirements.

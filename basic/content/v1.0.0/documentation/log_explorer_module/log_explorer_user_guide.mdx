# Log Explorer User Guide

The Log Explorer Module, a central element of UTMStack, is purpose-built to deliver an exhaustive and comprehensive view of an organization’s log data. This dynamic, highly interactive tool is engineered to provide real-time visibility into log data, allowing for immediate filtering and nuanced analysis. It enhances user experience by allowing customized, efficient data searches through saved criteria, intuitive visualizations, flexible source selection, and comprehensive filtering options. Its central role in the proactive monitoring and effective management of network activities is indispensable to a well-maintained cybersecurity infrastructure.

## Overview

The Log Explorer interface has been thoughtfully designed for seamless navigation and efficient functionality. Its centerpiece is the Data Grid, a feature offering an extensive view of an organization’s log data based on the defined datasource and query. This module supports logical grouping of queries based on user-defined filters, and the capacity to open multiple tabs for various queries. This level of customization empowers users to save their search criteria for future use, making the tool adaptable and time-efficient. The Log Explorer module provides visually intuitive representations of logs, with interactive charts and graphs to facilitate an at-a-glance understanding of data trends and patterns, simplifying the task of data interpretation.

## Key Features

### Source Selection

A crucial data filtering tool, the source functionality in the Log Explorer module lets users narrow down their search to specific index patterns. For example, users can confine their search to logs originating from Office365 exclusively, thereby eliminating unnecessary data noise.

In addition, this module offers the flexibility to create custom index patterns or sources. This allows users to define search parameters that cater to their specific needs, providing a level of personalization that ensures a more targeted and efficient search experience.

### Filtering Functionality

Serving as the backbone of the Log Explorer, the filtering functionality offers comprehensive data parsing based on the user’s search requirements. Filters can be defined to track logs from a specific computer, or to isolate logs pertaining to a specific operation, such as a log-in event. The versatility of these filters provides an unparalleled level of control over data analysis.

**New in filters:**

*   A **clear filter** button has been added to the far left, allowing users to instantly remove all active filters with a single click.
*   A **default time filter** is now applied automatically. This filter appears on the right-hand side and defaults to the last 24 hours. It dynamically updates based on the selected time range.
*   The **maximum range for any selected time filter is 30 days**. This limitation ensures optimal system performance while allowing deep log exploration.
*   Users can still add additional custom filters using the **Add Filter** button, providing even greater flexibility in log exploration.

The Log Explorer module simplifies filter creation by providing the option to add a filter based on a specific log field with a single click.

### Data Grid

The Data Grid is where the bulk of log information can be viewed, offering users the choice of viewing the data in a table or chart format. This visualization is predicated on a selected field, allowing for a high degree of customization. Users can also define the columns they want to see in the Table mode view, either through the Select fields option on the left, or by directly selecting a field in the log.

### The Log Section

The Log section offers a comprehensive view of all log information, ranging from `agent_id`, process name, to the source IP. This data can be viewed in two ways – either in a table view or in a JSON mode – depending on the user’s preference.

The Table mode offers the added benefit of allowing the user to add filters based on the field and value of a specific log, or to create a column in the Data Grid table based on a specific field.

### Log Field Options

Each log field within the Log Explorer module provides two key options for users:

*   **Adding a filter**: Based on the field and value of a specific log, users can swiftly add a filter. This feature further fine-tunes the data presented in the Data Grid, refining the log data to fit the user’s specific needs.
*   **Creating a column**: Users can choose to create a new column in the Data Grid Table based on the field. This feature allows for immediate visibility and accessibility of key data points.

### Personalize Fields

Users can add or remove columns in the Data Grid view, based on the fields of the logs.

### Saving and Exporting Information

Users can refresh their data, save the current query for future use, or export the current data to a CSV file for offline analysis. The option to view and manage stored queries also ensures that past investigations can be revisited with ease. For example, a filter to view all Office365 log-in activities could be saved for future use, negating the need to repeat the filter creation process.

By offering these customizable options, the Log Explorer module delivers an adaptable interface that caters to the specific requirements of individual users. Whether it’s streamlining data analysis by focusing on certain values or enhancing visibility of crucial data, these options ensure a more efficient and tailored log exploration experience.

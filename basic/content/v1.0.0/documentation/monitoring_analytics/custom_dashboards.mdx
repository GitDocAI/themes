# Custom Dashboards

UTMStack provides a comprehensive and flexible platform for building and configuring custom dashboards, enabling real-time system monitoring, security data analysis, and compliance oversight. Designed to adapt to unique organizational needs, UTMStack's dashboards can be created, modified, and deleted without requiring custom coding.

## Overview of UTMStack Dashboards

The UTMStack Dashboard is a comprehensive interface that displays a collection of visualizations and searches. It serves as a powerful dashboard and report builder, allowing users to personalize their monitoring experience and perform advanced compliance auditing and reporting. The entire solution is built on a proprietary data visualization and analysis engine, offering advanced users the flexibility to build their entire monitoring stack from the ground up.

## Key Capabilities and Use Cases

### Real-time Monitoring and Analysis
*   **Explore systems data** in near real-time and respond to incidents.
*   **Monitor and analyze security data** to identify threats and suspicious activities.
*   **Monitor and analyze device performance** and resource utilization to reduce downtime.
*   **Review proactive alerts** for misconfigurations or misconfigured systems.

### Data Aggregation and Forensic Analysis
*   **Aggregate and summarize** sets of data.
*   **Filter, track, and export** log data for detailed investigation.
*   **Perform forensic analysis** through log exploring.

### Compliance and Auditing
*   **Create compliance dashboards** for continuous monitoring of regulatory requirements.
*   **Generate custom reports** for audits or compliance checks and assessments.

## Creating and Managing Dashboards

UTMStack offers flexible options for dashboard creation and management:

### Creating a New Dashboard
Users can develop a new, custom dashboard from scratch. Selecting the 'New Dashboard' feature launches the Dashboard Editor. Within the Dashboard Editor, users can designate data sources, apply filters, and set other parameters to tailor the dashboard to their specific requirements. Dashboards and reports can be created, modified, and deleted without writing a single line of code.

### Importing Dashboards
The 'Import Dashboard' function allows for the incorporation of previously exported dashboards. This capability is beneficial for duplicating similar dashboards across different sections or recreating a dashboard in a new UTMStack instance, streamlining deployment and consistency.

## Data Sources and Integrations

UTMStack monitors a wide array of systems and platforms, feeding data into custom dashboards. Integrations are configured within the system panel and do not require custom coding or complicated configurations.

Monitored systems and platforms include:
*   Azure and AWS
*   Hypervisors (KVM, HyperV, VMWare, etc.)
*   Physical Infrastructure (datacenter)
*   Software like SharePoint and SQL Server
*   Windows and Linux servers and endpoints
*   PaaS and SaaS applications like Office365
*   Proprietary devices like CISCO and Sophos
*   Container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker)

## Summary

Custom Dashboards in UTMStack provide a powerful and flexible way to visualize, manage, and analyze critical system and security data. Users can build, modify, and delete dashboards without code, leveraging a proprietary data visualization engine. These dashboards support real-time monitoring, security data analysis, compliance reporting, and incident response across a wide range of integrated systems and platforms, helping organizations reduce downtime and maintain a strong security posture.

# Demo Site Access Issues

This guide provides troubleshooting steps for accessing the UTMStack demo site, including actions to take when the site does not load or provide a login form.

## Overview of the Issue

Attempts to access the UTMStack demo site at `https://demo.utmstack.com/` have shown that neither this URL nor the official UTMStack 'Online Demo' page provides a visible login form or direct access method. The demo site may remain blank, preventing further exploration or login with provided credentials. The official site, `https://utmstack.com/demo`, might display informational text about credentials being sent via email after completing a form, but the form itself may not be present on the page.

## Troubleshooting Steps

If you are encountering difficulties accessing the UTMStack demo site, follow these steps:

1.  **Initial Page Load and Waiting:**
    *   Navigate to `https://demo.utmstack.com/` in your browser.
    *   Wait for 5 seconds to allow the login form or page content to load.
    *   Refresh the page.
    *   Wait for another 10 seconds for the application to load its login form or initial content.
    *   Wait for an additional 10 seconds to observe if any content or a login form appears.

2.  **Refresh and Online Search:**
    *   Refresh the page again to attempt loading the login form or interactive content.
    *   Search Google for known issues or alternative access methods using the query "UTMStack demo site not loading".
    *   Scroll through the Google search results to identify and review any relevant information or status updates.

3.  **Check Official UTMStack Site for Alternatives:**
    *   Open `https://utmstack.com` in a new tab.
    *   Look for official updates or alternative demo access options on the main site.
    *   Click on the 'Online Demo' button, typically found on `https://utmstack.com/`, to attempt accessing a working demo environment or login form.
    *   If prompted, proceed with authentication after accessing the demo environment.

## Exploration Findings

During an exploration, it was found that neither `https://demo.utmstack.com/` nor the official `https://utmstack.com/demo` provided a login form or a method to use credentials. The demo site remained blank. The official site indicated that credentials would be sent via email after completing a form, but no such form was visible on the page.

## Next Steps and Manual Intervention

If the above steps do not resolve the access issues and you are still unable to reach a functional demo environment or login form, manual intervention may be required. This could involve clarification regarding alternative access methods, or if you have received demo credentials via email, providing them for further troubleshooting.

## Summary

Accessing the UTMStack demo site can sometimes be challenging due to the absence of a visible login form or direct access method. Troubleshooting involves a series of page refreshes, searching for online issues, and checking the official UTMStack website for alternative demo links. If these steps are unsuccessful, further assistance or manual intervention may be necessary to gain access.

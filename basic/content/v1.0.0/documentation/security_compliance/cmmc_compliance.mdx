# CMMC Compliance

UTMStack simplifies and streamlines the process of achieving and maintaining CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification) compliance. Designed to automate critical tasks, UTMStack helps organizations align their IT infrastructure and networks with CMMC controls through continuous evaluation, evidence gathering, and comprehensive reporting.

## Accessing CMMC Compliance

To manage CMMC compliance within UTMStack:
1.  Navigate to the **Compliance menu**.
2.  Select **CMMC**.
3.  Ensure the **CMMC framework** is selected.

This will display a dashboard with the various controls that apply to CMMC.

## Automated CMMC Control Evaluation

UTMStack automates the evaluation of each CMMC control:
*   **Automatic Evaluation**: Each security control is automatically assessed by the system.
*   **Evidence Gathering**: If a security control is met, the system automatically gathers the necessary evidence.
*   **Reporting**: Compliance status dashboards are provided, and reports can be exported into PDF format.
*   **Non-Compliance Identification**: The system also indicates if a control is not being met.

## Manual Overrides and Evidence Provision

For situations where controls are met through means not automatically detected by UTMStack, the system provides flexibility:
*   Users have the ability to **override the system's evaluation**.
*   Evidence can be manually provided to support the override.

## Detailed Reporting and Visualization

UTMStack offers robust reporting capabilities to help visualize and manage CMMC compliance:
*   **Specific Control Reports**: Each control comes with its own detailed report, allowing for a better visualization of how the organization meets that specific security control.
*   **Compliance Status Dashboards**: Interactive dashboards provide an overview of compliance status.
*   **Custom Compliance Reports Builder**: Users can create custom reports for audits or continuous monitoring.
*   **Advanced Data Visualization**: The platform includes a powerful dashboard and report builder for advanced compliance auditing and reporting, allowing dashboards and reports to be created, modified, and deleted without writing code.

## Streamlining the Compliance Process

The core purpose of CMMC compliance within UTMStack is to streamline the process of aligning IT infrastructure and networks with CMMC controls. This is achieved by combining essential security tools into a single database, reinforced by an event and logs explorer for advanced analysis.

## Regular Updates

To ensure accuracy and relevance, UTMStack's CMMC compliance systems are regularly updated:
*   New reports and automated checks are released at least once a month.

## Broader Compliance Management Capabilities

UTMStack is a Unified Threat Management Platform that provides comprehensive compliance management. Beyond CMMC, it offers built-in compliance reports for various other regulations, including:
*   HIPAA
*   GLBA
*   SOC 2
*   GPDR
*   FISMA
*   PCI-DSS

The platform's compliance management features include:
*   Compliance status dashboards.
*   A custom compliance reports builder.
*   Audit and compliance support for generating custom reports and creating compliance dashboards for continuous monitoring.

## Underlying Technology Supporting Compliance

UTMStack's ability to support CMMC and other compliance frameworks is built upon its integrated security services:
*   **Log Management (SIEM)**: Real-time log collection and correlation, log management, and a log and event explorer for forensic analysis.
*   **Threat Detection Technology**: Leverages rule-based correlation systems (154,000 detection rules), scanners, and AI-powered machine learning algorithms to analyze log data, network traffic, and system activity from on-premises, cloud devices, and SaaS.
*   **Machine Learning Anomaly-based Engine**: Analyzes the environment to define custom rules and baselines, learning from the environment to identify abnormal and threatening behavior.
*   **Threat Intelligence Database Correlation**: Analyzes security IP feeds related to online attacks, service abuse, malware, botnets, and cybercrime.
*   **Network and Host Intrusion Detection**: Rule-based network intrusion detection and rule-based/heuristic analysis-based Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) with ATP capabilities.
*   **User Activity Monitoring**: Tracks user activity and permissions, and monitors for suspicious activity.
*   **File Classification**: Tracks file changes, access, and integrity monitoring.

These integrated capabilities ensure that the data required for CMMC compliance is continuously monitored, analyzed, and available for reporting.

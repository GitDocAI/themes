This documentation page provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing Connection Keys within UTMStack. Connection Keys are vital for establishing secure authentication and communication between agents and various system components, ensuring the integrity and security of your UTMStack environment.

## Connection Key Overview

The Connection Key is a fundamental component of UTMStack, serving as a secure token to establish trusted communication between components within the system. It is a unique key, typically +24 characters, that authenticates connections to the UTMStack server.

### Purpose and Use Cases

The Connection Key plays a crucial role in several processes:

*   **Agent Installation**: The Connection Key is utilized as a panel token integrated within the agent installation command line. This token authenticates the agent, allowing it to communicate securely with the central panel and maintain a secure environment. When installing agents on target machines or devices, the Connection Key is included in the command line instructions to successfully authenticate and link the agents to the central panel.
*   **Federation Service Connection**: This key enables the management of the UTMStack instance through a Federation Service, specifically for multitenancy. This is essential for environments where multiple separate entities or administrative domains require access to the system. The Connection Key facilitates a secure connection to a Federation Service, ensuring that all federated instances are properly managed and maintained within a centralized framework.
*   **Secure Communication**: Connections to the UTMStack server are authenticated with this unique key, ensuring secure data transit between agents and UTMStack servers.

## Security Considerations

Maintaining the security integrity of your Connection Key is paramount. It is vital to:

*   Change it regularly.
*   Change it immediately if there is any suspicion of compromise.
*   Avoid sharing the key with untrusted parties.
*   Keep a secure backup of your Connection Key in a safe location.

## Generating a New Connection Key

If there is a need to generate a new Connection Key, the process is straightforward:

1.  Locate and click the `Generate new connection key` button within the UTMStack interface.
2.  This action will create a new, unique key to replace the old one.

### Post-Generation Steps

After generating a new Connection Key, it is critical to:

*   Update the new key across all deployed agents and services that use it.
*   Ensure that the new key is distributed securely to prevent service disruption.

## Summary

The Connection Key is a critical secure token within UTMStack, essential for authenticating agents, enabling federation services for multitenancy, and securing communication between system components. Regular updates, secure distribution, and protection against compromise are vital for maintaining the security and operational integrity of your UTMStack deployment.

# Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing UTMStack on Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS using the installer file method. It covers system resource recommendations, preparation steps, execution of the installer, and required network ports.

UTMStack is an open-source SIEM/XDR solution licensed under the AGPL version 3. It ensures secure communication through TLS encryption, container isolation, unique authentication keys, and 2FA for user credentials, which are also encrypted in the database and protected by fail2ban mechanisms.

## Recommendations

### Operating System

This installation guide is specifically for performing the UTMStack installation on **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**.

### System Resources

Resource allocation for UTMStack depends on the number of data sources and desired hot log storage retention. The following table provides recommendations based on an assumption of 60 data sources generating approximately 100 GB of monthly data.

**Definitions:**
*   **Hot log storage**: Not archived data that can be accessed for analysis at any time.
*   **Cold log storage**: Archived data that should be restored before accessing it.
*   **Data source**: Any individual source of logs, for example, devices, agents, SaaS integrations.

| Data Sources | Hot Log Storage (GB) | Cores | RAM (GB) | Disk Space (GB) |
| :----------- | :------------------- | :---- | :------- | :-------------- |
| 50           | 120                  | 4     | 16       | 150             |
| 120          | 250                  | 8     | 16       | 250             |
| 240          | 500                  | 16    | 32       | 500             |
| 500          | 1000                 | 32    | 64       | 1000            |

**Important:** You may combine these tiers to allocate resources based on the number of devices and desired hot log storage retention. Going above 500 data sources/devices requires adding secondary nodes for horizontal scaling.

## Installation Methods

UTMStack can be installed using an installer file or an [ISO image](https://utmstack.com/install). The instructions below are only for the installer file option. If you are using the ISO image, please refer to the [Installing UTMStack from ISO](/v10/Installation/install_from_iso) guide.

> **_NOTE:_** The default Ubuntu Server credentials are; "user: utmstack", "password: utmstack".

## Installation Steps (Installer File)

### Preparing for Installation

Perform the following steps to prepare your Ubuntu Server for the UTMStack installation:

1.  **Update packages list:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```
2.  **Install WGET:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install wget
    ```
3.  **Download the latest version of the installer:**
    ```bash
    wget http://github.com/utmstack/UTMStack/releases/latest/download/installer
    ```
4.  **Change to root user:**
    ```bash
    sudo su
    ```
5.  **Set execution permissions for the installer:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x installer
    ```

### Running Installation

After preparing your system, execute the installer:

-   **Execute the installer without parameters:**
    ```bash
    ./installer
    ```

Once UTMStack is installed, the default user for login is `admin`. The password for this user is generated during the installation and can be found in `/root/utmstack.yml` along with other generated configurations.

**Note:** Use `HTTPS` in front of your server name or IP to access the login page.

## Required Ports

The following ports are required for UTMStack operation. It is recommended to create firewall rules to restrict access to these ports as specified:

*   **22/TCP Secure Shell**: We recommend creating a firewall rule to allow it only from the administrator workstation.
*   **80/TCP UTMStack Web-based Graphical User Interface Redirector**: We recommend creating a firewall rule to allow it only from administrator and security analyst workstations.
*   **443/TCP UTMStack Web-based Graphical User Interface**: We recommend creating a firewall rule to allow it only from administrator and security analyst workstations.
*   **9090/TCP Cockpit Web-based Graphical Interface for Servers**: We recommend creating a firewall rule to allow it only from the administrator workstation.
*   **Other ports**: Additional ports will be required during the configuration of UTMStack's integrations to receive logs. Please follow the security recommendations provided in the integration guides.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Is this based on Grafana, Kibana, or a similar reporting tool?**
    Answer: It is not. UTMStack has been built from the ground up to be a simple and intuitive SIEM/XDR.
*   **Does UTMStack use ELK for log correlation?**
    Answer: It does not. UTMStack's correlation engine was built from scratch to analyze data before ingestion and maximize real-time correlation.
*   **What is the difference between the Open Source and Enterprise version?**
    The enterprise version includes features that would typically benefit enterprises and MSPs, such as support.

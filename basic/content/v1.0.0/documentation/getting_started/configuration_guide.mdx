*   Managing **Dashboards** and **Dashboards Lists**.
*   **Creating a Dashboard** to visualize data.
*   Managing **Visualization List** and **Creating a Visualization** for data representation.

### Data Sources
Configuration for data ingestion involves:
*   Setting up **Data Sources** from various origins.
*   Managing **Collectors** responsible for gathering data.

### Log Explorer
The **Log Explorer Module** allows for detailed log analysis and management.

### Correlation Rules
Users can configure and manage:
*   **Correlation Rules** to identify patterns and anomalies in log data.
*   **Customizable Rules** to tailor detection logic to specific needs.

### Threat Management
Configuration for threat management includes:
*   **Alert Management** for handling security alerts.
*   Defining **False Positive** conditions to refine alert accuracy.
*   Integrating and managing **Threat Intelligence** feeds.

### Compliances
Compliance features offer configuration for:
*   **Compliance Management** to adhere to regulatory standards.
*   Setting up **Compliance Schedule** for automated reporting and checks.

### Features

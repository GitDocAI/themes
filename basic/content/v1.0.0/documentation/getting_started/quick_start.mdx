# Quick Start Guide

Get your first application running in under 5 minutes with this step-by-step guide.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have completed the [Installation](/v1.0.0/documentation/getting_started/installation) process.

### What You'll Need

* Terminal or command prompt access
* Text editor of your choice
* 5 minutes of your time

## Step 1: Initialize Your Project

Create a new project directory and initialize it:

```bash
mkdir my-first-project
cd my-first-project
platform init
```

This command will:

* Create the necessary project structure
* Generate configuration files
* Install required dependencies

> The initialization process usually takes 30-60 seconds.

## Step 2: Configure Your Project

Edit the generated configuration file `config.yml`:

```yaml
name: My First Project
version: 1.0.0
environment: development
```

### Understanding the Configuration

* **name** - The display name of your project
* **version** - Semantic version number
* **environment** - Current environment (development, staging, production)

## Step 3: Create Your First Resource

Create a simple resource file:

```bash
touch src/hello.txt
echo "Hello, World!" > src/hello.txt
```

## Step 4: Run the Development Server

Start the local development server:

```bash
platform dev
```

Your application is now running at `http://localhost:3000`

### Development Server Features

The development server provides:

1. ***Hot reload*** - Automatic refresh on file changes
2. *Error reporting* - Detailed error messages in the browser
3. **Performance metrics** - Built-in performance monitoring

  | Feature             | Usage Score |
  | ------------------- | ----------- |
  | Hot Reload          | 95          |
  | Error Reporting     | 85          |
  | Performance Metrics | 75          |
  | Debug Tools         | 65          |
  | Live Preview        | 90          |
</Chart>

## Step 5: Deploy Your Project

When you're ready, deploy to production:

```bash
platform deploy --env production
```

> Deployment typically takes 2-3 minutes depending on your project size.

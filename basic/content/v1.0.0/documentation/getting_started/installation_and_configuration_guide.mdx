### Log Explorer Module

The Log Explorer Module is a central and dynamic tool within UTMStack, designed to provide an exhaustive and comprehensive view of an organization’s log data. It offers real-time visibility, allowing for immediate filtering and nuanced analysis, which is indispensable for proactive monitoring and effective management of network activities.

#### Overview

The Log Explorer interface is designed for seamless navigation and efficient functionality. Its centerpiece is the **Data Grid**, which offers an extensive view of log data based on defined data sources and queries. This enables logical grouping of queries based on user-defined filters and the capacity to open multiple tabs for various queries. Users can save their search criteria for future use, making the tool adaptable and time-efficient. The module also provides visually intuitive representations of logs.

The Log Explorer offers options to save current data to a CSV file for offline analysis. Saved filters, such as one for Office 365 log-in activities, can be reused, eliminating the need to recreate them. The ability to view and manage stored queries ensures that past investigations are easily revisited. These customizable options deliver an adaptable interface, catering to specific user requirements for streamlining data analysis and enhancing visibility of crucial data.

#### Office 365 Login Failure Analysis: Step-by-Step Guide Example

This example demonstrates how to utilize the Log Explorer module to create, configure, and save a query focusing on all login failure events within Office 365 logs.

**Step 1. Source Selection**

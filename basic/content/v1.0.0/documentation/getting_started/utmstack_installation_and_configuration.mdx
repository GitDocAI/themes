# UTMStack Installation and Configuration

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for installing and configuring the UTMStack platform. This documentation page serves as a central resource, directing you to detailed guides, system requirements, and configuration options necessary to set up and manage your UTMStack environment effectively.

UTMStack documentation provides comprehensive guides, API references, integration instructions, and installation resources to help users get started, configure, and manage the platform.

## Installation Overview

The installation process for UTMStack involves preparing your system, understanding the architecture, and following specific setup procedures. UTMStack is open-source software licensed under the AGPL version 3.

### Recommendations

To ensure optimal performance and stability, consider the following recommendations for your UTMStack installation:

#### Operating System

The installation guide primarily focuses on instructions for performing the UTMStack installation on **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**.

#### System Resources

Resource allocation depends on the number of data sources and the desired hot log storage retention. A data source refers to any individual source of logs, such as devices, agents, or SaaS integrations. Hot log storage refers to not archived data accessible for analysis at any time, while cold log storage is archived data that requires restoration before access.

Here are general resource recommendations:

*   **For 50 data sources (approx. 120 GB/month hot log storage):**
    *   4 Cores
    *   16 GB RAM
    *   150 GB Disk Space
*   **For 120 data sources (approx. 250 GB/month hot log storage):**
    *   8 Cores
    *   16 GB RAM
    *   250 GB Disk Space
*   **For 240 data sources (approx. 500 GB/month hot log storage):**
    *   16 Cores
    *   32 GB RAM
    *   500 GB Disk Space
*   **For 500 data sources (approx. 1000 GB/month hot log storage):**
    *   32 Cores
    *   64 GB RAM
    *   1000 GB Disk Space

These tiers can be combined to allocate resources based on your specific needs for devices and hot log storage retention. For deployments exceeding 500 data sources/devices, adding secondary nodes for horizontal scaling is required.

### Installation Steps

UTMStack can be installed using either an installer file or an ISO image. The provided installation guidelines primarily detail the installer file option. If you are using the ISO image, these specific installer file instructions should be skipped.

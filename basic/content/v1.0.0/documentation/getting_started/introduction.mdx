  <StepperPanel header="Environment Setup">
    ### Configure Your Environment

    Set up your development environment with all required tools:

    - **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
    - **Docker**: For containerization
    - **Git**: Version control
    - **Cloud CLI**: AWS, Azure, or GCP CLI tools

    > [!WARNING]
    > Make sure all tools are properly installed before proceeding to the next step.
  </StepperPanel>

  <StepperPanel header="Project Configuration">
    ### Create Configuration File

    Create an `acme.yml` file in your project root:

    ```yaml
    version: 1.0
    name: my-awesome-app
    runtime: node18

    build:
      command: npm run build
      output: dist

    env:
      NODE_ENV: production

*   **Machine Learning Anomaly-based Engine**: Analyzes the environment to define custom rules and baselines, enabling the system to learn and identify abnormal and threatening behavior.
*   **Threat Intelligence Database Correlation**: Analyzes available security IP feeds related to online attacks, online service abuse, malware, botnets, command and control servers, and other cybercrime activities. Specific threat intelligence covers spam, malware, botnets, service abuse IP, denial of service, and brute force attack/scanner IPs.

### Intrusion Detection
*   **Network and Host Intrusion Detection**: Includes rule-based Network Intrusion Detection and a rule-based and heuristic analysis-based Host Intrusion Detection System with ATP capabilities.
*   **Network Analysis**: Performs network traffic, protocol, and DNS analysis.

### Incident Response and Endpoint Protection
*   **Automated and On-demand Incident Response**: Offers on-demand host lockdown, IP block, and remote-control console capabilities.
*   **Integrations**: Supports Antivirus, OSSEC, and Wazuh Integration.

### User and File Activity Monitoring
*   **User Auditor**: Provides user activity monitoring and suspicious activity monitoring, including tracking user activity and permissions.
*   **File Classification**: Tracks file changes and access, monitors activity, and ensures file integrity.

### Vulnerability Management
Provided as a standalone application, UTMStack's vulnerability management capabilities include:
*   Application vulnerability assessments.
*   Network device vulnerability assessment.
*   Azure and AWS vulnerability scans.

### Artificial Intelligence Security Operations Center (AI SOC) Analyst
UTMStack integrates an Artificial Intelligence Security Operations Center Analyst, provided through integration with OpenAI, to enhance security operations.

## Comprehensive Compliance Management

UTMStack simplifies compliance management by combining essential security tools into a single database, offering several built-in reports, interactive dashboards, and an event/logs explorer for advanced analysis.

*   **Reporting**: Generates custom reports for audits or compliance checks and assessments.
*   **Dashboards**: Creates compliance dashboards for continuous monitoring.
*   **Supported Regulations**: Leverages existing reports for HIPAA, GLBA, GPDR, SOC, FISMA, CMMC, and PCI-DSS compliance.
*   **Customization**: Includes a custom compliance reports builder.

## Advanced Data Visualization and Reporting

The platform features a powerful dashboard and report builder, allowing users to personalize their monitoring experience without writing any code. UTMStack's proprietary data visualization and analysis engine provides the flexibility to build custom dashboards and reports from the ground up to fit unique organizational use cases.

## Investigation and Real-time Monitoring

UTMStack facilitates in-depth investigation and real-time monitoring of security data.
*   **Suspicious Activity Investigation**: Aggregates and summarizes data, allows filtering, tracking, and exporting log data, and enables forensic analysis.
*   **Security Data Analysis**: Users can build customized dashboards or use existing ones to explore systems data in near real-time and respond to incidents.
*   **Cloud Monitoring**: Includes monitoring for cloud environments and SaaS applications like Office 365 and Google Cloud.

## Supported Environments and Applications

The UTMStack data visualization system facilitates managing use cases across various infrastructures and applications, including:
*   Azure and AWS
*   Windows and Linux servers and endpoints
*   Hypervisors (KVM, HyperV, VMWare, etc.)
*   PaaS and SaaS applications like Office365
*   Physical Infrastructure datacenter
*   Proprietary devices like CISCO and Sophos
*   Software like SharePoint and SQL Server
*   Container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker)

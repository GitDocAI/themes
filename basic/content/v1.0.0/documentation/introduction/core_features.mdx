# Core Features

UTMStack is a Unified Threat Management Platform designed to deliver essential security services. It is engineered for hybrid environments, allowing for easy deployment across on-premises and cloud providers. The platform bundles several cybersecurity products under a single solution, aiming to be cost-effective and simpler, reducing the learning curve for security professionals and the costs associated with multiple vendors. This unified approach also enhances the effectiveness of correlation engines and machine learning algorithms by consolidating all data in one place.

## Unified Platform Capabilities

UTMStack integrates a range of critical security services into a single platform, including:

*   Log Management (SIEM)
*   Threat Detection and Response
*   Real-time Correlation
*   Reporting
*   Compliance Reporting
*   Cloud Monitoring
*   SaaS Monitoring (e.g., Office 365, Google Cloud)
*   Vulnerability Management (provided as a standalone application)
*   Network/Host Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS)
*   Endpoint Protection Integration
*   Identity Activity Management (tracks user activity)
*   Automated and On-demand Incident Response
*   Forensics Analysis (through Log Exploring)
*   Artificial Intelligence Security Operations Center Analyst (provided through integration with OpenAI)
*   File Classification and Tracking
*   Threat Intelligence

## Threat Detection and Response

UTMStack's threat detection engine combines various technologies to provide a holistic analysis of security events.

### Threat Detection Technology

The engine comprises several rule-based correlation systems, scanners, and AI-powered machine learning algorithms. These modules operate independently, with functionalities often overlapping and interacting to generate a comprehensive analysis of events.

### Heuristic and Rule-based Analysis Engine

UTMStack leverages powerful correlation engines, which include a total of 154,000 detection rules. These engines aggregate, correlate, and analyze log data, network traffic, and system internal activity generated by on-premises and cloud devices or SaaS applications.

### Machine Learning Anomaly-based Engine

This engine analyzes the environment to define custom rules and baselines. Through this learning mechanism, the system gains the ability to identify abnormal and threatening behavior.

### Threat Intelligence Database Correlation

The platform analyzes all available security IP feeds, focusing on data related to online attacks, online service abuse, malware, botnets, command and control servers, and other cybercrime activities.

### Threat Intelligence

Specific threat intelligence capabilities include monitoring for:

*   Spam, malware, botnets, and service abuse IP-related activities.
*   Denial of service and brute force attack and scanner IPs.

### Incident Response and Endpoint Protection

UTMStack provides capabilities for rapid response and endpoint control:

*   Automated and On-demand Host lockdown, IP block, and remote-control console.
*   Antivirus Integration.
*   OSSEC and Wazuh Integration.

### Network and Host Intrusion Detection

The platform offers robust intrusion detection features:

*   Rule-based Network Intrusion Detection.
*   Rule-based and heuristic analysis-based Host Intrusion Detection System with Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) capabilities.
*   Network traffic, protocol, and DNS analysis.

## Log Management (SIEM)

UTMStack offers comprehensive SIEM capabilities:

*   Log collection and correlation in real-time.

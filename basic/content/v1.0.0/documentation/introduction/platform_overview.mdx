# Platform Overview

Welcome to the UTMStack Documentation. This page provides a comprehensive introduction to UTMStack, a unified and open-source cybersecurity platform designed to elevate your security posture.

UTMStack is an integrated and enterprise-ready Unified Threat Management Platform that delivers all essential security services. It is designed for hybrid environments and can be easily deployed across both on-premises infrastructure and various cloud providers.

## What is UTMStack?

UTMStack merges Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) technologies into a single, comprehensive solution. This unique approach allows for real-time correlation of log data, threat intelligence, and malware activity patterns from multiple sources, enabling the identification and halting of complex threats that may use stealthy techniques.

As an open-source project, UTMStack provides a powerful, cost-effective, and simpler solution by bundling several cybersecurity products under a single platform. This reduces the learning curve for security professionals and the costs associated with acquiring different tools from multiple vendors. Having all data in a single place significantly increases the effectiveness of correlation engines and machine learning algorithms.

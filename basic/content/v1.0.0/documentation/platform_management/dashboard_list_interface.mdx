## Key Elements of the Dashboard List

The Dashboard List interface is comprised of several functional elements designed to streamline dashboard management.

### Search Box

Located at the top of the Dashboard List, the search box facilitates swift retrieval of dashboards. Users can dynamically filter the list by typing in the dashboard name or associated keywords to narrow down their search.

### Dashboard Listings

This is the main component of the Dashboard List, presenting all available dashboards. Each listing provides crucial information and actions:

#### Information Displayed

*   **Name**: The unique name assigned to the dashboard.
*   **Description**: A brief explanation of the dashboard, including its purpose and the data it presents.
*   **Last Modified**: The date and time when the dashboard was last updated.
*   **URL**: The direct link to access the dashboard.

#### Reordering

The list can be reordered either by name or by the most recent modification date.

#### Action Buttons

Each dashboard listing includes several action buttons:

*   **Copy**: Copies the URL of the dashboard.
*   **Edit**: Allows modification of the dashboardâ€™s parameters.
*   **Delete**: Permanently removes the dashboard from the list.

### Import Dashboard

The 'Import Dashboard' function allows for the incorporation of previously exported dashboards. This capability is particularly beneficial for duplicating similar dashboards across various sections or recreating a dashboard in a new UTMStack instance.

The Log Explorer Module in UTMStack is a dynamic and interactive tool designed to provide comprehensive, real-time visibility into an organization's log data. It is a central element of the UTMStack platform, indispensable for proactive monitoring and effective management of network activities within a cybersecurity infrastructure. The module facilitates immediate filtering and nuanced analysis, supporting advanced log analysis, search capabilities, and log management features, including forensic analysis.

## Overview

The Log Explorer interface is engineered for seamless navigation and efficient functionality. Its centerpiece is the **Data Grid**, which offers an extensive view of an organizationâ€™s log data based on defined data sources and queries. This design allows for:

*   Logical grouping of queries based on user-defined filters.
*   The capacity to open multiple tabs for various queries.
*   The ability to save search criteria for future use, enhancing adaptability and time efficiency.
*   Visually intuitive representations of logs, with interactive charts and graphs to simplify data interpretation and understanding of trends.

## Key Features

The Log Explorer Module provides several interactive components to facilitate efficient log analysis.

### 1. Source

The source functionality is a crucial data filtering tool that enables users to narrow their search to specific index patterns. For example, users can confine their search to logs originating exclusively from Office 365, thereby eliminating unnecessary data noise. The module also offers the flexibility to create custom index patterns or sources, allowing users to define search parameters tailored to their specific needs for a more targeted and efficient search experience.

### 2. Filters

The filtering functionality serves as the backbone of the Log Explorer, offering comprehensive data parsing based on user search requirements. Filters can be defined to track logs from a specific computer or to isolate logs pertaining to a particular operation, such as a login event. This versatility provides an unparalleled level of control over data analysis.

**New in filters:**

*   A **clear filter** button has been added to the far left, allowing users to instantly remove all active filters with a single click.
*   A **default time filter** is now automatically applied, appearing on the right-hand side and defaulting to the last 24 hours. This filter dynamically updates based on the selected time range.
*   The **maximum range for any selected time filter is 30 days**, ensuring optimal system performance while allowing deep log exploration.
*   Users can add additional custom filters using the **Add Filter** button, providing greater flexibility.

The module simplifies filter creation by providing the option to add a filter based on a specific log field with a single click, allowing users to focus more on analysis.

### 3. Data Grid

The Data Grid is where the majority of log information is displayed. Users have the option to view data in either a table or chart format. This visualization is based on a selected field, allowing for a high degree of customization. Users can also define the columns they wish to see in Table mode view, either through the "Select fields" option on the left or by directly selecting a field within the log.

### 4. The Log

The Log section provides a comprehensive view of all log information, including details such as `agent_id`, `process name`, and `source IP`. This data can be viewed in two formats: table view or JSON mode, depending on user preference.

### 4.1 Options

The Log Explorer module offers customizable options, including the ability to save the current data to a CSV file for offline analysis. For instance, a filter configured to view all Office 365 login activities can be saved for future use, eliminating the need to recreate the filter. Additionally, the option to view and manage stored queries ensures that past investigations can be revisited with ease. These options contribute to an adaptable interface, streamlining data analysis and enhancing the visibility of crucial data for a more efficient and tailored log exploration experience.

### 5. Personalize Fields

This feature allows users to customize the fields displayed, providing control over which data points are visible for analysis.

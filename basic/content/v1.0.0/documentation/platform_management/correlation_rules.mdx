# Correlation Rules

Correlation Rules in UTMStack provide defined frameworks that assist analysts in detecting network threats. This guide outlines their configuration, role in threat correlation, and management of automated analysis rules within the platform.

## Overview of Correlation Rules

Correlation rules in UTMStack are designed to swiftly identify potential security incidents through automated log analysis. They are defined frameworks that aid analysts in detecting network threats by processing data in real-time, even pre-ingestion. This robust system is a critical defense mechanism, essential for maintaining network security and compliance in UTMStack environments.

UTMStack leverages powerful correlation engines that aggregate, correlate, and analyze log data, network traffic, and system internal activity. This data is generated by on-premises and cloud devices or SaaS, contributing to a holistic analysis of events.

## Threat Detection Technology

The UTMStack threat detection engine incorporates several rule-based correlation systems, scanners, and AI-powered machine learning algorithms. These modules can operate independently, and their functionalities may overlap and interact to provide a comprehensive analysis.

UTMStack utilizes a heuristic and rule-based analysis engine with a total of 154,000 detection rules. This extensive set of rules enables the system to:
*   Perform rule-based Network Intrusion Detection.
*   Conduct rule-based and heuristic analysis-based Host Intrusion Detection with ATP capabilities.
*   Analyze network traffic, protocol, and DNS data.

The platform also includes a Machine Learning Anomaly-based engine that analyzes the environment to define custom rules and baselines, allowing the system to learn and identify abnormal or threatening behavior.

## Key Configuration Fields

Correlation rules are defined using specific fields, each serving a distinct purpose in generating alerts and providing context for identified threats.

*   **name**: The name used for alerts generated by the current rule.
*   **severity**: The severity level of the alerts for this rule. Possible values include `Low`, `Medium`, `High` (use majuscule initial).
*   **description**: The description that will appear in the alerts.
*   **solution**: Specifies a known solution for the incident if one exists.
*   **category**: A category in which the alert can be grouped.
*   **tactic**: Indicates if an incident detected by this rule fits into any of the attack tactics.
*   **dataTypes**: A group of datatypes applied to a rule. Only logs with a `dataType` field matching at least one of these string values will be processed by this rule. This field accepts an array of string values, separated by commas.
*   **Reference**: A list of URLs providing more information about the attack.
*   **frequency**: How often, in seconds, the alert should be checked.
*   **cache**: This field declares that iterations will occur on the cache of the correlation engine and defines these iterations. When this field is used, it influences the use of the `search` field.

## Enterprise Version Features

The Enterprise version of the UTMStack correlation engine offers additional features not typically found in the open-source version. These include support, faster correlation, frequent threat intelligence updates, and Artificial Intelligence capabilities.

## Summary

Correlation Rules in UTMStack are fundamental for proactive threat detection and maintaining security posture. By leveraging a vast pool of detection rules (a total of 154,000), automated log analysis, and real-time data processing, UTMStack's correlation engine identifies potential security incidents and generates alerts based on configurable parameters like severity, category, and tactics. These rules are an integral part of UTMStack's unified threat management platform, contributing to its comprehensive security services including SIEM, threat detection, and compliance reporting.

# Enterprise vs. Open Source

This page outlines the key differences in features, support, and capabilities between the Open Source and Enterprise versions of UTMStack, providing a comparison to help understand their distinct offerings.

## Overview of UTMStack

UTMStack is an open-source, enterprise-ready platform that unifies SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and XDR (Extended Detection and Response) technologies. It is built from scratch with its own correlation engine designed to analyze data before ingestion, maximizing real-time correlation and enabling the identification and halting of complex threats. The platform focuses on real-time threat detection, correlation of log data, threat intelligence, and malware activity patterns from multiple sources.

Core capabilities of UTMStack include:
*   Log Management and Correlation
*   Threat Detection and Response
*   Threat Intelligence
*   Alert Investigation
*   File Classification
*   Security Compliance
*   Audit and compliance support
*   Monitoring and analysis of security data
*   Reducing downtime
*   Integrations
*   Log Explorer Module
*   Correlation Rules
*   Threat Management (Alert Management, False Positive, Threat Intelligence)
*   Compliance Management

## Key Differentiating Features

The Enterprise version of UTMStack includes additional features tailored to benefit enterprises and Managed Security Service Providers (MSPs). These features are not available in the open-source version.

**Enterprise Version Exclusive Features:**
*   **Support:** Dedicated support services.
*   **Faster Correlation:** Enhanced capabilities for quicker data correlation.
*   **Frequent Threat Intelligence Updates:** More frequent and timely updates to threat intelligence feeds.
*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Incorporates AI-powered analysis, including SOC AI features.

Both versions utilize the UTMStack correlation engine, which was built from scratch to analyze data before ingestion and maximize real-time correlation. Correlation in UTMStack happens before data ingestion, aiming to reduce workload and improve response times.

## Open Source Version Details

The core UTMStack project is open-source software, licensed under the AGPL version 3. The community is encouraged to contribute to the project.
